### Overview

**Eidolon** is a magic mod that draws on a lot of different inspirations, with aspects of alchemy and theurgy. It takes a bit of a dark perspective, also featuring mechanics themed around necromancy and soul manipulation. If you have ever wanted to play as a dark mage, performing strange rituals and communing with dark gods, this is the mod for you.
